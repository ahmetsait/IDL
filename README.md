###### Instant Data Loader module for [LF2](http://lf2.net)

This library contains easy to use C-like API for loading decrypted data files into [LF2](http://lf2.net)'s memory. The library is especially useful when building a data changer (like [LF2 IDE](https://github.com/NightmareX1337/LF2.IDE)). With the help of this library, a data changer can load data files into LF2's memory on the fly, instead of reopening LF2 and waiting for it to load datas itself all over again. This is known to boost productivity while modding the game, because changes take effect instantly.
